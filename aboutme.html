    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Hello, my name is Ibrahim Deir and I am currently a CSII student. I chose Computer Science as my pathway in order to help advance today's technology and hopefully create the technology of the future. I am a junior in Allen High School, I enjoy basketball and lifting weights, along with listening and creating music. I play the guitar and can play the Bb clarinet, and have enjoyed doing so for many years. I love my youth group at my church and love having a leadership position at my church where I can influence others in a positive manner.</p>
