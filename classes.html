    <h1>Classes</h1>

    <p>Some of my past experiences and classes include Fundamentals of Computer Science, a class that introduced programming languages such as Javascript and HTML. Another class is Computer Science I, a class that delved further into Computer Programming through the Swift language. In addition to these classes, I have spent personal time and effort learning the C++ language.</p>
    <p>Last year in Computer Science I, I learned many fundamental and important skills for programming, including the beginning of animation, drawing with turtles, finite state machines, functions, and working with karel.<p>
